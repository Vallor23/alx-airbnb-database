## ‚úÖ Relationships

- A **host** (User with role 'host') can list many properties.
- A **property** can have many bookings.
- A **booking** belongs to one property and one user.
- A **review** is left by a user about a property.
- Users can **message each other**.

## üìå Notes

- We are using `ENUM` for values like `role`, `status`, and `payment_method`.
- `TIMESTAMP` helps us track when things are created or updated.
